# virtual networks
This repository contains Ansible roles and playbooks used to construct a
virtual network to be used for development and/or demonstration purpooses.  
The playbooks in this repo support building virtual networks directly on KVM 
running on either bare metal servers or in virtual machines running on 
hypervisors that support nested virtualization.
